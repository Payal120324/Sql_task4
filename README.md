# Sql_task4

This project contains a set of SQL queries designed to analyze employee data stored in a relational database. The tasks cover various business insights such as:

Department-wise employee counts and salary totals

Gender distribution across departments

City-wise employee demographics and salary stats

Conditional filtering (e.g., salaries in London, departments with high pay or staff strength)

Aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, and AVG on department and city levels

These queries are useful for generating management reports and gaining deeper insights into organizational data.
